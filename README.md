## Documentation
- Phase 3 Requirements
- In Phase 3, we’d like to extend the functionality of the application by potentially allowing users to set a few configuration options to change how the application behaves. The user stories from Phases 1 and 2 remain unchanged. For this phase, we are now adding the following new user stories.

- As a user, I would like to see my To Do List Items a few at a time so that I don’t have to wade through them all
- As a user, I would like my default view to only be “Incomplete” Items so that I can quickly determine what I have to do.
- As a user, I would like my list sorted by difficulty so that I can more easily prioritize
- As a user, I would like the option to change my default preferences with regards to how many Items I see per page, which items are filtered, and how they are sorted
